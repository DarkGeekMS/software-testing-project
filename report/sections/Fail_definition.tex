PyTest enables the user to give his own explanation for the failed assertions. This is useful for assertions that compare objects of the user-defined classes. \\
In the SUT when it is required to assert the 2 objects of class contours are the same. The user can define the explaination of the reason of failure which can be that the 2 lists of contours don't have the same size, or the 2 contours list have the same length but have different values. PyTest enables the user to define the explaination in \textbf{conftest.py} file as follows: \\

\begin{python}
def pytest_assertrepr_compare(op, left, right):
    .....
    elif (isinstance(left, Contour) and isinstance(right, Contour)
    and op == "=="):
        if(len(left.contour_array) != len(right.contour_array)):
            return [
                "equality of 2 contour lists",
                "Lengths: {} of contour 1 != {} of contour 2".format(
                len(left.contour_array), len(right.contour_array))
            ]
        else:
            return [
                "equality of 2 contour lists",
                "Contour inner values are different"
            ]
\end{python}
